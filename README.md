# EdiPhi Task

## Data Engineering Problem

## Overview

This project involves processing an Excel file containing construction estimates. The goal is to convert it into a JSON structure that is ready for use in further analysis or system integration.

## Jupyter Notebook

I have documented the entire process in an interactive Jupyter Notebook, which I highly recommend reviewing. The notebook contains detailed comments and markdowns that explain the problem-solving approach, discuss alternatives, and provide a conclusion. It serves as both a step-by-step guide and a comprehensive explanation of the methodology used.

### Key Features:

- Detailed explanation of the problem-solving approach.
- Inline comments to clarify the logic and steps in the code.
- Markdown cells providing a narrative of the process, making it easier to follow and understand.
- Interactive code cells that allow for dynamic execution and experimentation.

## Python Version

This project was developed using Python version 3.9.12. Please ensure that you have this version installed to avoid compatibility issues.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are essential for running the code in this project:

- openpyxl: Used for reading and writing Excel files.
- pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- json: Used for handling JSON data output.

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`EdiPhi_Task.ipynb`) and run the cells interactively to follow the process.
2. The notebook provides all necessary explanations and will guide you through the data processing steps.

## Conclusion

The Jupyter Notebook is not only a code repository but also a comprehensive documentation of the thought process, methodologies, and conclusions drawn from this task. Reviewing it will provide you with a thorough understanding of how the problem was approached and solved.
