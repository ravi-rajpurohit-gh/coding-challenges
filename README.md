# PurpleRain 🌧️💜

PurpleRain is a fun and simple rain animation built using the Kivy framework. This project simulates falling raindrops with randomized splash effects, attempting to create a visually appealing 3D-like depth. It also adds a "thunder" effect by changing the background color at regular intervals.

This is a work-in-progress project, and more features will be added soon! Feel free to explore, contribute, or fork the project to build your own version.

## 🚀 Features
- Falling raindrops with randomized speeds, thickness, and splash effects.
- Simulated 3D effect with depth (z-axis) influencing speed and size of raindrops.
- Thunder effect that periodically changes the background color.
- Built using **Kivy** for easy cross-platform GUI development.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Kivy 2.3.0 or higher
- `requirements.txt` contains the dependencies needed to run the project.
