The columns are:
1. row starts with "start"
-start
-number of points in time (length of track)
-genesis year
-genesis month
-genesis day
-genesis hour

2. row starts without "start"

-x grid point of the centre
-y grid point of the centre
-longitude
-latitude
-minimum stream function
-minimum sea level pressure
-Pressure drop (Pa) (other wise magnitude of closed contours of MSLP in Pa)
-Maximum Surface Wind (m/s) within 3 degrees
-Averaged relative humidity (in %) within 3 degrees at 850hPa
-Maximum surface geopotential within 2 degrees, which gives the surface elevation
-land sea ratio of the grid at the centre (1 for land 0 for sea);>0.5 consider as genesis over land 
-ACEPSL
-ACE
-PDI
-IKE
-year
-month
-day
-hour



Note:
ACEPSL = 1e-4 * (1.94384 kt/(m/s) * (3.92 * (1016 - PSL)^0.644))^2 if PSL < 1016.  Here PSL is the minimum surface pressure at the point of detection in hPa.  This formula leverages the TC wind-pressure relationship defined in Holland (2008) to provide a proxy for ACE.
ACE = 1e-4 * (1.94384 kt/(m/s) * Umax)^2, where Umax is the maximum instantaneous windspeed magnitude within the three degree radius (in m/s).
PDI = Umax^3, where Umax is the maximum instantaneous windspeed magnitude within the three degree radius (in m/s)
IKE = sum_i 0.5 * U_i^2 * area_i, where the sum is taken over all grid boxes within the given radius, U_i is the wind magnitude in that grid cell, and area_i is the area of the grid cell (in m^2).
