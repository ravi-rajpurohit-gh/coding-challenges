    "- Identify pattern for knowing if a row is sort1/sort2 row and not a lineItem. I created a logic for this as - if a row would have no value (merged cell) for quantity, uom, labor, material, and unit_cost, this cell is sort1/sort2. If there are 2 continous such rows, it is sort1 and sort2, otherwise it is sort2.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the first method as I believe it could scale well and is less prone to data errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### reading excel file:\n",
    "I tried parsing the excel file through openpyxl, but encountered an issue -\n",
    "- It parses formulas as is, and did not read the value. For eg - for quantity, it said \"=3*11\" instead of 33\n",
    "- While reading in value_only mode, it would make such values NaN\n",
    "- Solved it by not modifying the excel file and reading through pandas\n",
    "- Found other possible solutions but did not implement for the sake of time\n"
